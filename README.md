# AntiSlide
Simple Browser Plugin for Alerting Users when Thread sliding is taking place on image boards

Currently only supports Chrome. Should work in all versions of Chrome browser.

Instructions: (Chrome)

1. Just download and unzip / or git clone if you're some kind of /gentooman.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and check the box for Developer mode in the top right.
3. Click the Load unpacked extension button and select the /src folder to install.

That's it. You should now have comfy flashing red warnings when you have stumbled into a slide thread on /biz /tv or /pol.
